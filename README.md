# PinIt
Chrome extension for creating bookmarks within a page.

The idea behind PinIt stems from the massive number of uber long blog posts I have started to read then needed a break from. I can bookmark the page but then I have to figure out where I read to which typically entails skimming back over a large portion of what I read to find where I stopped.

PinIt aims to solve this by allowing the user to place Pins on the page and scroll to those Pins with a few simple clicks.
